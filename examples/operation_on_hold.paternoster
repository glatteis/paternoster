↓        ←             i$ ! i$ A         ←
→ P "YOU'RE A | ? = $i 1 ⇃\SQUID\→ NOW!" ↑
                         →\KID\\\↑

The | char holds the ongoing operation and executes the next operation. If that is finished,
it will resume with the old ongoing operation.
This example demonstrates the operation on hold using an if clause that is inside a String
that is held.
It outputs
